    <h1 id="roboto">Roboto</h1>
    <link href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">
    <p>
      As mentioned in the "About" page for Roboto, the typeface is geometric and features open curves.
      The letters are allowed to be their natural width, making for a more natural reading rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in essence, it is a kind, easy-on-the-eyes font that allows for a friendly-feeling reading.
      This feeling of friendliness pairs very well with the warm, summer feel of Lato.
    </p>


    <h1 id="lato">Lato</h1>
    <link href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato">
    <p>
      Lato comes from the Polish word "summer." The goal of this font was to create a warm, friendly feel
      that could also be serious when it needed to be.
      "Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the summer."
    </p>
    <p>
      This description of the typeface is more than enough proof that is works well with Roboto.
      Both were designed to be friendly, and the serious nature that may follow them both leads
      to a match made in heaven.
