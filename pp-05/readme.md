## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results).

From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your
teams’s interface from Project Two**.

Finally, I highly encourage you to work on this Production Problem with your team for Project
Two/Three to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist, and smooth the way forward
for your first (and second) round of usability testing.

## Deliverables

* Your team’s condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. Readability - Text color and font doesn't subtract from the page or make things harder to read.
2. Tagging - All tags (HTML, CSS, JS) are sensible and fitting for its placement.
3. Loading Time - Page loading time is not unreasonable. It should be quick whilest keeping efficiency high.
4. Content - Content makes sense for the pages it is on. Content is displayed in an easy to read and clear manner. There are no spelling or grammar mistakes.
5. Links - Links, whether navigation or other, are unobtrusive and neat. Links lead to the correct pages when clicked.
6. Labels - Anything that has a label is labeled correctly. Labels are not excessive or hard to follow.
7. Error Pages - Error pages should be clear as to say what Kind of error occurred and perhaps how to fix them. Error pages should be helpful and not burdensome.
8. Goal - The goal of the website, whatever that may be, is achieved in a straightforward way. The goal should not be confusing to follow or achieve.
9. Designs - Website colors are not painful or difficult to look at. They should be clean colors that go well together. Any special designs are used strictly for designing; designs do not messily overlap text or images.
10. Cleanliness - All text, images, links, and other forms of content on a page are well-aligned in a sensible manner. Everything is straightened and neat and nothing overlaps that isn't supposed to.
